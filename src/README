## Module Overview

### 📁 application/
Contains all the application-level components, including API endpoints, visualization tools, and user interface elements. This layer serves as the interface between the system and its users.

### 📁 digital_twin/
Houses the core Digital Twin functionality and implementation. This module is responsible for managing Digital Twin instances and their lifecycle.

### 📁 services/
Contains various services that can be attached to Digital Twins. Services handle specific functionalities like analytics, monitoring, and database operations.

### 📁 virtualization/
Manages the virtualization layer of the system, including Digital Replica creation and schema management. This layer handles the representation of physical entities in the digital space.

## Architecture Overview

The system is designed with a layered approach:

1. **Virtualization Layer** (Bottom)
   - Handles digital representation of physical entities
   - Manages schemas and templates

2. **Services Layer**
   - Provides processing and functionality
   - Implements business logic

3. **Digital Twin Layer**
   - Integrates virtualization and services
   - Manages Digital Twin lifecycle

4. **Application Layer** (Top)
   - Provides user interfaces
   - Handles external communications

Each layer is designed to be independent and modular, allowing for easy maintenance and extensibility.
