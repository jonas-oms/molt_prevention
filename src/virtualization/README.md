## Overview

The virtualization layer is responsible for creating and managing Digital Replicas (DRs), which are virtual representations of physical entities. This layer ensures that the digital representations accurately reflect their physical counterparts and maintain data consistency.

### üìÅ digital_replica/

This subdirectory contains the core implementation for creating and managing Digital Replicas. It handles:

- Creation of Digital Replicas based on templates
- Schema validation and enforcement
- Management of Digital Replica lifecycles
- Data structure consistency

### üìÅ templates/

Contains schema definitions that define the structure and validation rules for different types of Digital Replicas. The templates:

- Define required and optional fields
- Specify data types and constraints
- Provide validation rules
- Support extensibility for custom attributes


## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear separation between schema definition and implementation
   - Modular design for easy extension

2. **Flexibility**
   - Support for different entity types
   - Extensible property system
   - Custom validation rules

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Strong schema validation
   - Consistent data structures
   - Automatic metadata handling

4. **Scalability**
   - Template-based approach for easy addition of new entity types
   - Efficient data representation

## Usage

The virtualization layer serves as the foundation for Digital Twin creation. It should be used to:

1. Define new entity types through schema templates
2. Create Digital Replicas of physical entities
3. Manage the lifecycle of Digital Replicas
4. Ensure data consistency and validation

## Integration Points

- Integrates with the Digital Twin core for entity management
- Connects with the database service for persistence
- Provides interfaces for service layer interaction
