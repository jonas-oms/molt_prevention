# Digital Twin

This directory contains the core implementation of the Digital Twin system. It provides the fundamental infrastructure for creating, managing, and orchestrating Digital Twins.

## Core Concepts

The Digital Twin implementation is based on these key concepts:

1. **Digital Twin Entity**
   - Virtual representation of physical entities
   - Integration of multiple Digital Replicas
   - Service management and orchestration
   - State and behavior synchronization

2. **Twin Composition**
   - Multiple Digital Replicas can form a single Digital Twin
   - Services can be dynamically attached and detached
   - Flexible configuration and customization

## Architecture Components

### Digital Twin Core
- Manages the lifecycle of Digital Twins
- Handles state synchronization
- Coordinates service execution
- Manages Digital Replica integration

### Factory System
- Creates and initializes Digital Twins
- Manages twin configurations
- Handles twin instantiation
- Provides twin templates

## Digital Twin Lifecycle

```
Creation → Configuration → Operation → Maintenance
```

- **Creation**: Initial twin instantiation
- **Configuration**: Service and replica setup
- **Operation**: Active data processing and synchronization
- **Maintenance**: Updates and reconfiguration

## Integration Guidelines

1. **Service Integration**
   - Standard service interface
   - Event handling mechanisms
   - Data flow patterns
   - Error handling

2. **Data Management**
   - State persistence
   - Data synchronization
   - Cache management
   - Consistency maintenance

3. **Event System**
   - Event publication
   - Subscription management
   - Event processing
   - Event routing


The system can be extended through:
- Custom Digital Twin types
- New service implementations
- Additional management capabilities
